			<p id="biopar">I am Bryce Greene, an 18-year-old Indiana University student. I went to Pike High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. During my time as a senior, I engaged in internships at Time Compression Strategies, and Eleven Fifty Accaedmy. Currently, I am pursuing an Informatics Degree with a cognate in music. Though I don't know specifically the path I will take after graduation, but I am very excited too see where this journey will take me.</p>
